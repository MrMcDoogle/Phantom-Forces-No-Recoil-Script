# Phantom-Forces-No-Recoil-Script
This is an AutoHotkey script that negates all camera recoil for any gun in Phantom Forces.
All you have to do is install AutoHotkey v1, paste the script into Notepad, enter the gun stats from in-game under the configuration section of the script (advanced recoil stats), enter the gun rpm, and tweak your sensitivity scalar to match your in-game sensitivity, run the script with AHK v1, and boom, no camera recoil.
